B. Minimize the error

problem tags : greedy,sortings,data structures , 1500*

I have figured out two solutions for this problem :

## https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/960/B

-- the first solution is way better for time limit exceeding using multiset DataStructure 

-- because multiset is hierarchical DataStructure with log(n) for insert and erase

--but in the memory side the solution is not the best



-- second algorithm is better for the memory bu may give a time limit exceeding in other problems in the same catigory
